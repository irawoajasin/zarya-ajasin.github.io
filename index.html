    The goal of this site is basically a more casual portfolio of things
    that I enjoy creating in addition to my more career-focused or academic work.
    It will have a bit more general info and personality that my portfolio.
    The design aesthetic goal was to keep things very minimal, centered, and consistent
    between the pages. Very light colors to be "soft" on the eye and sans-serif typography
    to emphasize the cleanliness. I really wanted to implement a side nav bar right next to
    the content that stayed static when the user scrolls through the page. This was again to
    have all interactivity on the site (buttons, clickables, etc) to be central. I intent
    on adding some visual pieces of interest (like light gradient bubbles) in the empty space.
    The other visual feature I plan on implementing is a custom cursor using js. Lastly, 
    I used the general w3schools info in flexboxes but no template to complete this site.
