                    <h1>&#10036 about me</h1>
                    <p>I'm currently an undergraduate at Georgia Tech working towards a Bachelor’s degree in <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/academics/degrees/bachelors/computational-media-bs" class = "emphasized">Computational Media</a> with a focus on <span class="emphasized">Human-Computer Interaction and Interaction Design</span>.
                        <br><br>
                        My career thus far has been focused on tackling real-world problems within the social good space through <span class="emphasized">artful technical solutions</span> that explore alternative futures for social software. My design philosophy centers <span class="emphasized">intimacy and softness within digital spaces</span> by designing collaborative and equitable solutions for impact driven goals.                        <br><br>
                        When I’m not working, you can find me &#128218reading political history, &#127911making spotify playlists, or &#128690biking around Atlanta.
